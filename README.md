# ZUNE Adapters

#### (W.I.P)

A repository containing runtime adapters to run with [zune](https://github.com/Scythe-Technology/zune) runtime. The **adapters** themselves are based on the luau types of the runtime's API. This is to allow you to run your existing code built for other runtimes, on zune with an adapter equivalent from this repository.

The goal for the **adapters** is to implement a zune equivalent of the runtime's API.

Bugs and issues while using the adapters, should be reported here, and not to any runtime.
